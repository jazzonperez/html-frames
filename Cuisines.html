<h3><a href="CP.html"><img src="CP.jpg" height="50" width="80"><a name="CP">Crispy Pata</a></h3>
<UL type="disk">
<LI>1 pork pata (pork leg), wash well
<LI>1 cup soda pop (Sprite or 7-up)
<LI>water, for boiling
<LI>coarse sea salt
<LI>1 tsp. peppercorns
<LI>5 cloves garlic, crushed

Cooking Procedures :
Clean pork pata. Slit skin (3-5 slits on each side) without cutting the bone.
Place pork pata in a big pot. Add soda pop and water enough to cover the pork.
Season with plenty of salt. Add peppercorns, crushed garlic, bay leaves and soy sauce.
Covered and boil over high heat. Remove all the resulting scum that will rise to the top of the pot. Lower the heat and simmer for about an hour or until pork pata meat is tender (make sure that meat is not too tender).
About 15 minutes of simmering, add baking soda (to soften the meat faster) and continue cooking.
Drain pork pata when done. Let sit for a while so the juices settle. Dry with paper towels.
Deep-fry pata until golden brown and blisters appear on skin. Drain on paper towels.
Slice meat and transfer to a serving plate. Serve hot with sauce for dipping.
Make sauce by combining soy sauce and white vinegar. You may add garlic, onion and chili pepper. Depends to your liking. Enjoy your crispy pata. !

<h3><a href="PB.html"><img src="PB.jpg" height="50" width="80"><a name="PB">Pork Barbecue</a></h3>
<UL type="disc">
<LI>1 lb. pork (pork belly or lean pork), cut thinly
<LI>salt and pepper, to taste
<LI>1 to 2 cups Mama Sita’s Barbecue Marinade
<LI>1 tbsp. calamansi concentrate
<LI>1 tsp. salt
<LI>1/4 tsp. pepper
<LI>bamboo sticks, for skewer
</UL>

Cut pork into thinly slices (or whatever suits to your liking). This makes the meat cook faster in lesser time.
Place sliced meat in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Let sits for 30 minutes.
Pour in MS Barbecue Marinade, calamansi concentrate, salt and pepper. Marinate pork for at least an hour or two, or overnight, in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, soak bamboo sticks in water for at least 30 minutes to an hour (or even over night). This prevents the sticks in burning while grilling.
Skew pork in bamboo sticks. If you want to use up the excess marinade, be sure to let it come to a boil first, before basting onto grilling meat, to destroy any harmful bacteria.
Preheat grill over medium heat.
Grill and baste pork until well cooked.
Transfer to a serving platter. Serve with your favorite sauce. Enjoy!
